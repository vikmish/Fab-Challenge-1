## Board game for Collboration

A board game as a tool for collaboratively generating new ideas within and the MDEF classroom and beyond. 

We wanted to create a practical and fun tool to help designers ideate their next collaboration or project. We also wanted to tie in themes and practices from traditional non-western indigenous cultures that are commonly undervalued as 'not logical', 'myths', or 'non-scientific', and bring them into the design process as tools for creative ideation. 

We started by sharing different belief systems, mythologies, indigenous practices, and visuals from each of our cultures. Through this exercise, we found many commonalities within our different cultural stories and designs. 

We made preliminary sketches of the board game, and discovered there were many different directions we could take it. I think we spent a bit too much time discussing the concept behind the game and how the game would be played before we moved into prototyping something. We spent the first two days working out the concept and the form on paper. On the third day, after speaking with Dafni, who encouraged us to start making test prints, we made a test on Illustrator which we transfered into Rhino.

The first prototype pieces, we rushed and forgot to focus the laser. We only realized this after we printed the pieces with 2.4mm of cut width, which was 0.1mm less than the width of the MDF board, but the divots were loose and didn't connect well. Following this test, we tested several other widths, 

We tested 

Learnings: 
- Start prototyping early! Especially when working with machines and materials when we're not familiar with. 
- Test and leave room for error
- Always create laser cutting files with the size of the laer
- Build parametric with Grasshopper whenever thickness and joints of material is involved.
